Depending on attendance, we will either run 2 or 3 groups at our discretion.

### Step Down Program (Applicable when running 3 groups)

To maximize lapping times for our members, we are implementing a step down program. This allows you to ride in sessions below the group you registered in.

If you are riding in a session below the one you've registered in, you absolutely MUST respect the riders in that session and the corresponding passing rules. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of your step-down privileges for that day and a public disciplinary berating from Drew.
