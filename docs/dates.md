## Location

![gb](/img/raceway.jpg)

KW Sport Racing is ran exclusively at Grand Bend Motorplex (Grand Bend Raceway). The excellent facility and multiple track layouts make it very welcoming and is a key factor to our decision of renting the track.

### Day Overview

- 8:00pm on the day before: Gates Open, camp overnight if you'd like!

- 7:30am-8:20 Tech

- 8:30-8:45 Rider's Meeting

- 8:50 Sighting Lap - Required for all who have not been to GBM before

- 9:00 Lapping Starts

- 12:00 Lunch

- 12:45 Group Picture

- 1:00 Lapping Starts

- 5:00 Lapping Ends

Depending on attendance, we will either run 2 or 3 groups at our discretion. Regardless, registration will be capped at 20 bikes/group.

### Step Down Program (Applicable when running 3 groups)

To maximize lapping times for our members, we are implementing a step down program. This allows you to ride in sessions below the group you registered in.

If you are riding in a session below the one you've registered in, you absolutely MUST respect the riders in that session and the corresponding passing rules. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of your step-down privileges for that day and a public disciplinary berating from Drew.
