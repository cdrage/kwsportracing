### Passing & Other General Rules

- Novice/Green: Passing restricted to straights
- Intermediate/Yellow: Once bike in front of you has initiated their turn in, passing is restricted until after the apex
- Advanced/Red: Passing permitted anywhere. however this is a track day, not a race. Do not be overly aggressive

If you are in a session below the one you've registered in, you absolutely MUST respect the riders in that session and the corresponding passing rules. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of your step-down privileges for that day.

Remember, everyone is here with a common hobby and the desire to improve. Do not be afraid to ask for help & advice. Likewise, please be generous and pass on your skills to other riders. Be social and part of the community!


### Rain Policy

In the event that the forecast is showing a strong chance of rain, we will open a poll for those that have pre-registered for that day.

If the majority vote in favor of running the day, the day will be run as normal.

If majority vote against, that day will be cancelled and full refunds will be issued to those who have pre-registered

The decision on whether or not the day will run will be announced on our Facebook page 48 hours before the event. Those that have pre-registered will also receive emails to let them know of this update.
