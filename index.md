## Location

![gb](/img/raceway.jpg)

KW Sport Racing is ran exclusively at Grand Bend Motorplex (Grand Bend Raceway). The excellent facility and multiple track layouts make it very welcoming and is a key factor to our decision of renting the track.

## About Us

We are a new trackday organizer founded in 2018 as a branch of our street riding group: KW Sport Riding. Our group is centered around building relationships within the community and continually improving our riding skills. We had a successful pilot day at GBM last season and received tons of positive feedback! For the 2019 season, we are hosting 7 track days at GBM. The facility along with their staff provides some of the best track riding in Southern Ontario!

We strive to provide a positive, welcoming atmosphere and a strong sense of community with each track day we host.

### Step Down Program (Applicable when running 3 groups)

To maximize lapping times for our members, we are implementing a step down program. This allows you to ride in sessions below the group you registered in.

If you are riding in a session below the one you've registered in, you absolutely MUST respect the riders in that session and the corresponding passing rules. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of your step-down privileges for that day and a public disciplinary berating from Drew.

## Rules and Requirements


### Technical Requirements

- Coolant MUST be replaced with either distilled water or a mix of distilled water & water wetter
- Lights & mirrors must be taped up
- Kickstands must be zip tied IF the return spring does not properly snap stand back.
- Tires and brake pads must be in good condition
- Throttle must snap back
- Absolutely no leaks of any kind (Check: Brake fluid, oil, fork seals, coolant)
- No loose parts on motorcycle

### Gear Requirements

- Leather jacket and pants; either 1-piece or 2-piece with 360-zipper
- Gauntlet style gloves; no exposed skin

### Passing & Other General Rules

- Novice/Green: Passing restricted to straights
- Intermediate/Yellow: Once bike in front of you has initiated their turn in, passing is restricted until after the apex
- Advanced/Red: Passing permitted anywhere. however this is a track day, not a race. Do not be overly aggressive

If you are in a session below the one you've registered in, you absolutely MUST respect the riders in that session and the corresponding passing rules. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of your step-down privileges for that day.

Remember, everyone is here with a common hobby and the desire to improve. Do not be afraid to ask for help & advice. Likewise, please be generous and pass on your skills to other riders. Be social and part of the community!

### Rain Policy

In the event that the forecast is showing a strong chance of rain, we will open a poll for those that have pre-registered for that day.

If the majority vote in favor of running the day, the day will be run as normal.

If majority vote against, that day will be cancelled and full refunds will be issued to those who have pre-registered

The decision on whether or not the day will run will be announced on our Facebook page 48 hours before the event. Those that have pre-registered will also receive emails to let them know of this update.
