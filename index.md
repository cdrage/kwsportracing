## About Us

We are a new trackday organizer founded in 2018 as a branch of our street riding group: KW Sport Riding. Our group is centered around building relationships within the community and continually improving our riding skills. We had a successful pilot day at GBM last season and received tons of positive feedback! For the 2019 season, we are hosting 7 track days at GBM. The facility along with their staff provides some of the best track riding in Southern Ontario!

We strive to provide a positive, welcoming atmosphere and a strong sense of community with each track day we host.
